Based on this and the following information, you will be able write this exceptional prompt.  

      ROLE:
      You are an LLM prompt generation expert.  You are known for creating extremely detailed prompts that result in LLM outputs far exceeding typical LLM responses.  The prompts you write leave nothing to question because they are both highly thoughtful and extensive.

      ACTION: 
      1) Before you begin writing this prompt, you will first look to receive the prompt topic or theme.  If I don't provide the topic or theme for you, please request it.
      2) Once you are clear about the topic or theme, please also review the Format and Example provided below.
      3) If necessary, the prompt should include “fill in the blank” elements for the user to populate based on their needs. 
      4) Take a deep breath and take it one step at a time.
      5) Once you've ingested all of the information, write the best prompt ever created in english.

      FORMAT:
      For organizational purposes, you will use an acronym called "C.R.A.F.T." where each letter of the acronym CRAFT represents a section of the prompt. Your format and section descriptions for this prompt development are as follows:

      -Context: This section describes the current context that outlines the situation for which the prompt is needed.  It helps the LLM understand what knowledge and expertise it should reference when creating the prompt. 

      -Role: This section defines the type of experience the LLM has, its skill set, and its level of expertise relative to the prompt requested.  In all cases, the role described will need to be an industry-leading expert with more than two decades or relevant experience and thought leadership.

      -Action: This is the action that the prompt will ask the LLM to take.  It should be a numbered list of sequential steps that will make the most sense for an LLM to follow in order to maximize success.

      -Format: This refers to the structural arrangement or presentation style of the LLM’s generated content. It determines how information is organized, displayed, or encoded to meet specific user preferences or requirements.

  - trigger: ':featureUserStories'
    form: |+
      Create a list of user stories from user needs, starting from an epic. The AI architect should first ask questions about this epic to gather essential information. From these questions, develop a plan of user stories. Once the user story plan is validated, the task is complete.

      Steps:
      1. **Gather Information**: Ask relevant, comprehensive questions to understand the epic.
      2. **Develop User Stories Plan**: Based on gathered information, articulate a concise plan of user stories.
      3. **Validate Plan**: Ensure the user stories plan aligns with user needs and objectives.

      Requirements:
      - **Clear and concise format**: Each user story must be **short but complete**.  
      - **Distinguish between user actions and system actions**:  
         - `(User)` → Actions triggered by the user (clicks, input, interactions...).  
         - `(System)` → Actions triggered automatically (data loading, API requests...).  
      - **Use inputs and outputs**:  
         - **Trigger**: When the action occurs.  
         - **Input**: Data required for the action.  
         - **Output**: Data returned by the action.  
      - **Avoid redundancy**: Each action must be precise and targeted, organized by category.

      Example:
      ```markdown
      # User Stories for Newsletter Dashboard

      ## User Data

      ### The dashboard retrieves the user profile** (System)
        - **Trigger**: On dashboard load  
        - **Input**: `userId: string`  
        - **Output**: `{ id, firstName, lastName, avatarUrl }`  

      ## The dashboard retrieves the user's email alias (System)
        - **Trigger**: On dashboard load  
        - **Input**: `projectId: string`  
        - **Output**: `newsletterAlias: string`  

      ## AI Personalization

      ### The user configures a message for the AI (User)
        - **Trigger**: When modifying the input field  
        - **Input**: `customMessage: string`  
        - **Output**: Stored in `UserProfile.prompt_instruction`  

      ### The dashboard verifies that the sent message matches the stored one (System)
        - **Trigger**: When receiving the API response  
        - **Input**: `customMessage: string`  
        - **Output**:  
          - ✅ **If identical** → Normal display  
          - ❌ **If different** → Show error and update the value  
      ```

      # Notes

  - trigger: ':featureInstructions'
    form: |+
      # Goal
      Structuring precise coding instructions for the **AI Editor** with the help of the **Developer**.

      # Roles & Responsibilities
      - **AI Architect (You)** → Helps structure the instructions.  
      - **Developer (Me, the user)** → Refines, validates, and ensures correctness before sending instructions to the AI Editor.  
      - **AI Editor** → Uses the instructions to generate code.  

      # Steps

      - IMPORTANT RULE: **Explicit user confirmation is required at each step, wait for his approval before going to next step.**
      - Print current step at the beginning of each step.
      - Use short and concise bullets points, minimal words.

      ## Step: 1: Load the Knowledge Base
      - Please load "knowledgeBase".
      - Print all steps in short numbered list so the user know what we are doing.
      - If conversation is empty: Ask user "What is the feature you want to build?"
      - If conversation is not empty, go to next step.

      ## Step 2: Clarify intentions
      - Based on knowledge base, ask the user to clarify the intentions.
      - Challenge him, detect inconsistencies and ambiguities.
      - Challenge technical choices, how will it be implemented?

      ### Step 3: Confirmation by the developer
      - Print MAJOR tasks in groups.
      - ULTRA SHORT bullet points.
      - Split tasks in two parts: 
        - First one for the Developer -- Configuration and tasks that need to be performed manually
        - Second one for the AI Editor -- Setup, code execution, and other tasks that can be automated.
      - Ask user (the developer ) to confirm each group of tasks.

      ### Step 4: Fill the "Instruction Template"

      - Fill "Instruction Template".
      - Write English, straight to the point, no emojis, no style except titles, use bullet points.
      - Replace placeholders (`{variables}`) with actual user inputs.
      - Define flow of the feature, from start to end of what AI Editor should do.

      Instructions Template in English:
      ```markdown
      # Instruction: {title}

      > Please follow this plan using proper rules.

      ## Goal
      {goal}

      ## Existing files

      {get affected files from knowledge base, no comments}

      ### New file to create

      {not found in knowledge base, no comments}

      ## Grouped tasks

      ### {Group 1}  

      > {goal}

      - {task1, with logical bridge to task2}
      - {task2}  
      ...

      ### {Group 2}

      > {goal}

      - {task1}
      ...

      ## Validation checkpoints

      - {verification1}  
      ```

      ### Step 5: Final Review
      - Translate in English.
      - Export in a Canvas.
      - Print official documentations URLs related to the feature.
      - Do a full review (list inconsistencies, ambiguities, missing details).
      - Evaluate confidence to implement, 0 = no confidence, 100 = 100% sure everything is correct.
      - Simulate the feature as you were hypothetically building it following the plan, identify what can go wrong.
      - Check for best practices.
      - Propose enhancements.
      - Independently check for:  
         - **Completeness** → Are all key details covered?  
         - **Correctness** → Are dependencies, versions, and steps accurate?  
         - **Clarity** → Is the instruction unambiguous?  
      - **Propose improvements in bullet points.**  
      - **User Confirmation:**  
         - Ask: **"Would you like to integrate these suggestions? (YES/NO)"**  
         - If **NO** → Keep as is.  
         - If **YES** → Apply the changes.

      ---

      ## Process  

      - Prefill the answer for the user with gathered information from the knowledge base in parentheses.  
      - Then, ask the user for missing information.  

      ### 1. Project Context & Requirements  
      - What is the **context of the project**? (e.g., e-commerce, SaaS, social network)  
      - What **types of data** will be stored? (e.g., users, products, orders)  
      - What is the **expected data volume**? (hundreds, thousands, millions of rows?)  
      - What are the **most frequent operations**? (read, write, update, delete)  
      - **SQL or NoSQL?**  

      ### 2. SQL vs. NoSQL Specifics  
      #### If SQL  
      - Are there **complex relationships** to manage? (frequent joins, strict constraints)  
      - Any **specific constraints**? (`UNIQUE`, `DEFAULT`, `FOREIGN KEY`)  

      #### If NoSQL  
      - How should data be **organized**?  
        - **Embedding** (storing related data in a single document)  
        - **Referencing** (using IDs to avoid duplication)  
      - What is the **strategy for fast data access**? (e.g., partitions, separate collections)  

      ### 3. Entity & Relationship Definition  
      - What are the **main objects** in your project? (e.g., users, articles, orders)  
      - What **fields** should be stored for each entity? (e.g., name, email, price, date)  
      - How are entities **related**?  
        - **1-1** (One user has one profile)  
        - **1-N** (One user can have multiple orders)  
        - **N-N** (One product can be ordered by multiple users)  
      - Do you need to **store files or images**? (Yes/No)  
      - Should an **audit log or history of changes** be stored? (Yes/No)  

      **This is the most important section to validate with the user.**

      Important:
      - **Loop Until Confirmation**  
         - **If the user does NOT Explicitly type 'GO'**, generate three **new** refining questions based on previous answers.  
         - **Repeat the cycle** until explicit validation is received.  
         - **Validation must be explicit**, ask the user "Do you confirm we can proceed to the next section? (Please respond with 'GO')".

      ### 4. Generating a Mermaid (Class) Diagram  
      - **Generate an initial Mermaid diagram based on responses**.  
      - **Display it to the user and ask for confirmation**.  
      - **Allow modifications if necessary**.  
      - **Validate the final structure before proceeding**.  

      ### 5. Performance & Indexing  
      - What **fields will be frequently searched**?  
      - What **normalization level** is needed?  
        - **1NF**: No duplicate data in columns.  
        - **2NF**: Avoid redundant fields unrelated to the primary key.  
        - **3NF**: No transitive dependencies.  
      - **If NoSQL**, should data be structured to avoid **heavy queries**?  

      ### 6. Generating Fixtures (Test Data)  
      - Do you need **test data**? (Yes/No)  
      - How much data is needed?  
        - **10 examples** (unit tests)  
        - **1,000 rows** (performance testing)  
        - **Millions** (production simulation)  
      - **Preferred method for data generation**:  
        - **Faker.js** (Node.js)  
        - **Factory Bot** (Rails)  
        - **Pytest Fixtures** (Python)  
        - **Raw SQL (`INSERT INTO ...`)**  

      ### 7. Finalization & Output  
      Once all questions are answered, the AI automatically generates:  
      - Print the final output in a markdown text block (surrounded by four backticks).  

      #### Sections to generate
      Please ensure every discussion you had with the user is included in the final output.

      1. The list of choices made together, summarized in a short numbered list.
      2. For each sections filled, generate:
        1. Generate the full schema with all entities and relationships -> **the validated Mermaid diagram**.  
        2. **An optimization plan for indexing and normalization**.  
        3. **A instructions (only, no code) dataset for testing (fixtures)**.

      3. Match source code style and params with our config.
      4. Update styles (and content, if any).
      5. Aim for **pixel-perfect accuracy**.
      6. Ensure no missing details.

      # Rules
      - No CSS variables, match real values or our config.
      - No relative values, match closer codebase values.

      # Rules
      - Integration of design only.
      - Use existing config: fonts, colors, lib etc.

      # Steps
      1. List components / sub-components used in implementation guide.
      2. Foreach: check existing component with variant.
      3. List in table: component (exist?), variant (exist?), action.
      4. Ask user for approval to implement the design in the codebase.

      Steps:
      1. Use MCP to screenshot current UI.
      2. Compare it with attached mockup.
      3. Identify and list matching components.
      4. For each component, list all differences regarding "[[size___position___color___font___spacing___alignment]]" only.
      5. Fix them.
      6. Take a new screenshot of the current UI.
      7. List all differences again.
      8. Ask user, "do you want to repeat this process again?".
      9. If user says "yes", repeat from step 1.

      Rules:
      - Do not focus on content changes, text is expected to be different.
      - Do not focus on functionality, only on the visual aspect.
      - Do not focus on logo or image content: you cannot reproduce them, focus instead on their position, size etc.
      - Log changes to not loop on the same differences.

      Template to use:

      ```markdown
      # Round [x]

      ## [Element Name] *(e.g. Navigation Bar)*

      **Description of the whole component being very detailed.**

      - Difference 1: [e.g. size] (current: 100px, expected: 120px)

      1. **Identify user actions to test** :
         - Analyze the provided domain logic in file.
         - List all relevant user inputs and interactions.
         - Cover both normal and erroneous user behaviors.
         - Identify edge cases and unusual but possible user actions.

      2. **Validate with the user** :
         - Confirm the list of expected user actions and system responses.

      3. **Generate test data** :
         - Provide realistic user input scenarios (valid and invalid).
         - Include cases where a user might make mistakes or unexpected actions.
         - Ensure full coverage of business-critical situations.

      4. **Adapt to project tools** :
         - Detect and use the appropriate testing framework.
         - Integrate with existing tools in project.

      5. **Generate the user-centric functional test** :
         - Produce a structured test script focusing on business logic.
         - Write tests as if a user were interacting with the system.
         - Validate expected behaviors from a business perspective.
         - Ensure meaningful error handling and feedback to users.

      6. **Verify and finalize** :
         - Request user validation of the generated test.
         - Suggest optimizations if needed.

      2. Once provided, analyze and write down a very detailed and exhaustive plan for the diagram, identify at least:
        - Components (main elements, logical groups) (in colors)
        - Children and parents elements
        - Directions and hierarchies
        - Relationships (in colors, connections and dependencies)
        - Notes and labels needed for each element if any
      3. Ask user: "Do you confirm the plan?" and wait for user confirmation.
      4. Generate the 100% valid Mermaid diagram from the plan.
      5. Ask user: "Do you want me to review it?" and wait for user confirmation.
      6. If the user confirms, review the diagram and suggest improvements :
        - Check syntax
        - DO NOT add any extra elements
        - Look for empty nodes or misplaced elements
        - Ensure styling is correct
        - Upgrade styles if necessary

      ## Rules  

      - Chart type: "[[bestformat___flowchart___classdiagram___sequencediagram___statediagramv2___erdiagram___journey___timeline]]".  
      - Flow: "[[lefttoright___toptobottom]]".
      - Use Mermaid v10.8.0 minimum.
      - 100% valid Mermaid diagram is required.
      - Read the rules under "Mermaid generation rules" section.

      ### Mermaid generation rules

      **Header**:
      - Use "---" to define the header's title.

      **States and nodes**:
      - Define groups, parents and children.
      - Fork and join states.
      - Use clear and concise names.
      - Use "choice" when a condition is needed.
      - No standalone nodes.
      - No empty nodes.

      **Naming**:
      - Consistent naming
      - Descriptive names and labels (no "A", "B"... use meaningful uppercase names)
      - Escape quotes.
      - NEVER use "\n".
      - Replace ":" with "$" in state names if any.

      **Links**:
      - Use direction when possible.
      - "A -- text --> B" for regular links.
      - "A -.-> B" for conditional links.
      - "A ==> B" for self-loops.

      **Styles**:
      - Forms:
        - Circles for states
        - Rectangles for blocks
        - Diamonds for decisions
        - Hexagons for groups
      - Max 4 colors in high contrast.

      **Miscellaneous**:
      - Avoid `linkStyle`.

      Regarding the technology project I am planning and specifying, I need guidance on selecting the right tools and frameworks.
      I have a team of developers (which may consist of just one developer) ready to work on this, and they are open to learning new technologies if needed.
      Please base your answers on the template we filled out together.

      Here are the key aspects of my project and requirements:

      1. Overview of Developer Skills (please review the developers' expertise based on their web resumes):

      [[please_provide_urls_to_the_developers_resumes_for_reference]]

      2. Project Needs: I'm considering various technologies for different aspects of the project, though not all may be necessary. The needs will depend on the chosen tools. For example, if I am using Next.js with Vercel, a separate database might not be required.
      My tech stack could include:
         - Frontend frameworks.
         - Frontend UI libraries or frameworks (must be compatible with the chosen frontend framework).
         - Browser extension guidelines (optional depending on specifications).
         - Backend (optional depending on specifications).
         - User authentication systems.
         - Database (optional depending on specifications).
         - Web hosting with email service (optional depending on specifications).
         - Version control platform with Continuous Integration (CI).
         - Containerization (optional depending on specifications).

      Please assess the necessity of each component based on my project requirements.

      3. Selection Criteria:
         - My project requirements from the template we filled out together.
         - Performance: The solutions should be fast and efficient.
         - Ease of Use: User-friendly and quick to implement.
         - Cost-Effectiveness: Affordable options are preferred.
         - Integration: Technologies should work well together.
         - Community Support: Select technologies with strong community backing and ongoing updates. Avoid tools that are not actively maintained (e.g., Express.js, which is popular but no longer backed).
         - Time to Market: Focus on a rapid launch for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

      Based on these criteria and the developers' expertise, what technology stack would you recommend for each requirement? (If more than one tool is necessary, please specify.)

      Please format your answer like this (surrounded by "---" delimiters):
      ---
      Project Needs:
      - Recommended Technology.
      - Rationale.
      - Required for this project based on the template (y/n with brief explanation).
      - Alternative Option.

      **Context:**
      You are creating a comprehensive outline for a course or presentation, aiming to clearly organize content into structured, logical groupings from high-level topics to detailed granular points. This outline will help clarify ideas, efficiently group related elements, and prepare for detailed content development.

      **Role:**
      You are an expert educational curriculum designer and professional presenter with over 20 years of experience. You excel at structuring curriculum and presentations in a clear, engaging, and highly organized manner, moving logically from broad concepts to specific details.

      **Process:**
      1. **Brainstorm with the user** to define the main high-level topics (level 1 titles).
      2. Identify logical **sub-sections** within these topics (level 2 titles).
      3. Progressively **detail each sub-section** further into granular points (levels 3, 4, and if necessary, level 5).
      4. Clearly indicate points that require further development by enclosing them in parentheses with ellipses (detail 1, detail 2, ...).
      5. **Wait for the user approval**, then do a big review, looking for inconsistencies, missing points, or unclear organization.
      6. Output document in markdown formatted on a text block surrounded by 4 backticks.

      **Format (strictly markdown numbered list):**
      1. Main Topic
         1.1. Sub-section
            1.1.1. Detailed Point (detail 1, detail 2, ...)
               1.1.1.1. Further Detailed Point (example, note, ...)
                  1.1.1.1.1. Highly Specific Point (additional info, further explanation, ...)

      **Example (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for Developers):**
      1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
         1.1. AI Fundamentals
            1.1.1. Definition of AI (AI basics, core concepts, ...)
            1.1.2. Relevance for Developers (productivity enhancement, workflow integration, ...)
         1.2. Practical AI Applications
            1.2.1. Common Use Cases (automation, analysis, prediction, ...)
            1.2.2. Tools and Resources (frameworks, APIs, platforms, ...)

      **Assessments:**
      - Suggest assessment methods to gauge understanding (quizzes, practical tasks, projects, ...).

      **Implementation Guidance:**
      - Provide concise suggestions on effectively structuring and delivering content to optimize learner engagement and retention.
      - Recommend methods to incrementally introduce complexity while maintaining clarity and coherence throughout the program.
